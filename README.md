### What's this ?

First of all, it's NOT a tutorial. It just gives it all away, giving some potential solutions to some problem that everyone might come across when playing with shell scripting. 

### What are in there ?

Inside this repository are some of the scripts I used or I think that might be useful in manipulation of text in Linux/Mac OS environment categorised by problem. More solutions might be commmited in the future.
