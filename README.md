# Welcome !

## What's this ?

- Some (very basic) cases of text manipulation on Linux I had problem with and some commands or scripts I managed to solve them.  

- It's NOT a tutorial. It simply records the attempts I made and just gives it all away, showing some potential solutions to those practical cases. They might not be the most efficient but everytime when I figure out any way faster or interesting I will put it here. 

- I am still learning shell scripting and some interesting commands i.e., awk, sed. etc. You are always welcomed to share your ideas here XD
